 ZenZone Bot is an AI-powered chatbot that promotes mental well-being. It uses NLP and ML to provide personalized mindfulness exercises, stress-relief tips, and mental health resources, helping users manage stress effectively.

ZenZone Bot incorporates several advanced features to provide personalized mental health support:

Keyword Recognition Model: Utilizing the NLTK library, the bot can recognize and respond to specific keywords in user input. This helps in identifying the primary concerns and topics of the conversation, enabling more relevant and targeted responses.

Sentiment Analysis: The bot employs TF-IDF vectorization and a random forest generator to analyze the sentiment of user messages. This allows the bot to understand the emotional tone of the conversation, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral, and respond appropriately to support the userâ€™s mental state.

Text Summarization: Using the LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) summarizer and plaintextparser, the bot can condense longer user inputs into concise summaries. This helps in efficiently processing and understanding the core message of the user, making interactions smoother and more effective.

Intent Recognition: The bot leverages a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for intent recognition. This enables it to accurately determine the user's intent behind their messages, ensuring that the bot can provide relevant and helpful responses or direct the user to appropriate resources.
